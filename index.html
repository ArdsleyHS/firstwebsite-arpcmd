 So test day's finally come around. Bring the following to the testing room:
  <ol> 
    <li> Calculator</li>
    <li> Extra batteries/backup calculator</li>
    <li> Pencils and erasers</li>
    <li> Some form of ID </li>
  
  <p> "I'd say the most entertaining part of the PSAT was having the directions read aloud. Good times." </p>
